    <h1>QuickAI Extension Test Page</h1>
    
    <p>This is a test page for the QuickAI Chrome extension. You can test the conversation trail feature by selecting any text on this page and clicking the question mark button that appears.</p>
    
    <p>The <span class="highlight">conversation modal</span> should now maintain a history of all your questions and AI responses during a single session. Each new message should appear below the previous ones, creating a continuous conversation flow.</p>
    
    <p>Try selecting different parts of this text and asking multiple questions to see the conversation trail in action. The conversation history will be cleared when you close the modal or select new text.</p>
    
    <h2>Example Text for Testing</h2>
    
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of modern technology, transforming how we interact with computers and process information. From natural language processing to computer vision, AI technologies are reshaping industries and creating new possibilities for innovation.</p>
    
    <p>Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This capability has led to breakthroughs in areas such as healthcare diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, and personalized recommendations.</p>
    
    <p>As AI continues to evolve, ethical considerations become increasingly important. Questions about bias, transparency, and accountability must be addressed to ensure that AI systems benefit society as a whole.</p>
